# Deadly Surgery

Quite an unfortunate turn of events


## About me, I guess

I'm a software engineer located in Missouri, US, and have been developing software professionally since 2015. My speciality is backend services, primarily ran on cloud infrastructure. I mostly use Golang but I can pretty much use any language thrown at me, the most annoying one being COBOL (jk it's PHP, 10 times worse). 

The project I'm currently working on revolves around micro controllers, and figuring out why my ESP32 is dropping TCP connections without informing me.
